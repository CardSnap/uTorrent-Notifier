uTorrent Notifier
=================

uTorrent Notifier is a .NET application that runs in the system tray and, well, notifies you of events ocurring remotely in uTorrent. 

Supports notifications being sent by Growl, Prowl, Twitter and Boxcar.

See [https://github.com/ejholmes/utorrent-notifier-daemon](https://github.com/ejholmes/utorrent-notifier-daemon) for a linux command line tool that can run as a daemon and send notifications.
